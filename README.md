## Hello connection . 

I along with my team have successfully completed our mini project as part of our microcontrollers and assemebler course. We created a fastest finger first quiz buzzer for four participants 
with a master reset button . We used PIC16F877 Microcontroller and MPLAB to accomplish our project. The github Repository link is given below . This was a mini project which we were able to complete in less than a week . The hardware components are :
4 buzzers
4 LEDS 
4 BC547 Transistors 
5 Buttons 
4 10K resistors 
The working of the project can we viewed below . The Buzzers auto reset after 20 seconds and during this time all the buttons are deactivated until the master reset button is presed by the organiser. I would like to thank my teammates deepak sriyank and gowtham for helping me out with this . Cheers to more projects. 
Thank You.
